**Purpose of the Module**

The top.v module controls the RGB LED on the FPGA board by generating different color outputs (red, green, and blue) based on an internal clock. It uses an internal oscillator to create the clock signal and drives the LED channels (RGB) using simple counter logic, which toggles based on the clock's cycles.

**Description of Internal Logic and Oscillator**

The internal logic of this module relies on an internal high-frequency oscillator (SB_HFOSC) and a counter to create the LED toggling effect:
- Internal Oscillator (SB_HFOSC): The module utilizes the FPGAâ€™s internal oscillator to generate a stable clock signal at approximately 12 MHz. This clock signal drives the toggling of the counter, which ultimately controls the RGB LED states.
- Counter Logic: The internal counter keeps track of clock cycles. After a certain number of clock cycles, it toggles the RGB LED color outputs (led_red, led_green, led_blue). The counter determines the LED states by cycling through different combinations of the three colors.

**Functionality of the RGB LED Driver and Its Relationship to the Outputs**

The module uses the SB_RGBA_DRV component to drive the RGB LED:
RGB LED Driver (SB_RGBA_DRV): This module controls the current going to the red, green, and blue LED channels. By adjusting the current, it creates different brightness levels for each LED channel, allowing the RGB LED to display a range of colors.

**Outputs:**
- led_red: Controls the red channel of the RGB LED.
- led_green: Controls the green channel of the RGB LED.
- led_blue: Controls the blue channel of the RGB LED.

These outputs are driven by the counter logic, which toggles the LED colors based on the clock cycles. The combination of these three outputs produces a variety of color patterns on the RGB LED.
