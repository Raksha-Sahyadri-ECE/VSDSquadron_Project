# UART Sensor Data Transmission using VSDSquadron FM FPGA

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Implement a UART transmitter that sends real-time data from a sensor through the FPGA to an external device (e.g., PC), enabling communication via a serial terminal.

## ðŸ§± Project Structure


---

## ðŸ§© Circuit Connections

- Sensor data â†’ FPGA GPIO input pin
- FPGA TX (UART) â†’ USB-to-Serial Converter (FTDI)
- USB â†’ PC (e.g., COM7 on Windows)
- Common GND between FPGA and sensor

---

##  Code Overview

### `uart_trx.v`
- Implements UART protocol.
- Sends serial data (start bit, 8 data bits, stop bit) at defined baud rate.

### `top.v`
- Reads sensor input.
- Triggers UART transmission based on sensor state.
- Optionally blinks RGB LED for visual feedback.

## Implementation Steps

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Connect your sensor to the appropriate FPGA GPIO.
3. Synthesize the design using [Yosys/NextPNR](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr) or a toolchain like [icestorm](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/icestorm).
4. Flash the bitstream to the VSDSquadron FM board.
5. Connect the board to your PC via USB.

## ðŸ”¬ Testing and Verification

### Tools Used:
- **PuTTY** (Windows Serial Terminal)
- **COM7** (or applicable COM port)
- **Baud Rate:** `115200`

### Test Steps:
1. Open PuTTY â†’ Set connection type to **Serial**.
2. Set **Serial line** to `COM7`, **Speed** to `115200`.
3. Click **Open**.
4. Stimulate sensor (e.g., button press or change in temperature).
5. Observe output in terminal window: e.g., `Sensor Triggered`, `Value = 42`, etc.
6. Verify RGB LED behavior (optional).

##  Results

- UART transmission verified via serial terminal.
- Sensor inputs correctly mapped to serial data.
- RGB LED provided visual status indication.
- Reliable transmission with no observed data corruption.
